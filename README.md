Graceful degradation refers to the design principle that focuses on allowing an application to continue functioning (with limited capacities) even when some/most parts fail to run. Service workers help to implement this principle in web applications. Specifically, with their ability to intercept network requests and cache resources, they allow important features to work even in the case of internet connection loss.
